# Code Architecture

## GPT Prompt

Now write a flutter app that will play all three games.  Start by selecting the game and then move to gameplay.  I want you to cocreate the software.  First describe the overall architecture and the architecture for each game, reuse components as much as you can.  Make the description of each component sufficient enough for me to use that as a prompt for asking you to write the code.

Creating a Flutter application that can simulate playing all three card games ("Gridiron Master," "Field Command," and "Tactical Gridiron") involves designing an app architecture that supports modularity, flexibility, and reuse of components. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the overall architecture, followed by specific details for each game:

### Overall App Architecture

1. **Main Components:**
   - **Game Selection Screen:** Allows users to choose which game to play. It serves as the entry point of the application.
   - **Game Engine:** A modular engine capable of handling the rules and logic for each game, adjusting dynamically based on the game selected.
   - **UI Components:** Shared visual components such as cards, game board, and player stats that can be reused across different games with slight modifications.

2. **Data Management:**
   - **Game State Manager:** Manages the state of the game including player turns, scores, and positions.
   - **Player Profile Management:** Handles data related to player profiles, including statistics and game history.

3. **Networking (optional for multiplayer aspects):**
   - **Networking Manager:** Manages online connectivity for playing against remote players. Handles data transmission and synchronization.

4. **Utilities:**
   - **Animation and Effects:** For smooth transitions and engaging visuals.
   - **Helper Utilities:** Includes randomizers for card shuffling, validators for moves, and more.

### Specific Game Architecture

#### Gridiron Master

- **Deck Management:** Manages two decks (Player and Play Deck), handling shuffling, drawing, and card distribution.
- **Gameplay Controller:** Manages the logic for selecting plays, comparing card outcomes, and moving the ball on a virtual field.
- **Scoring System:** Calculates and updates the score based on the yardage gained or lost and touchdowns.

#### Field Command

- **Team Setup Manager:** Allows players to draft their teams and select lineups before each game, ensuring the team setup is saved and managed throughout the game.
- **Play Selector:** Handles the logic of selecting play cards and matching them with player cards for each turn, including the effects of these combinations on gameplay.
- **Field Progress Tracker:** Tracks the progression of the game in terms of downs and yardage, similar to an actual NFL game.

#### Tactical Gridiron

- **Grid System:** Implements a grid-based game board where player cards are moved. Handles the logic for player positioning and interactions on the grid.
- **Tactical Play Manager:** Manages the selection and implementation of tactical plays that affect the game at the grid level, including offensive and defensive strategies.
- **Interaction Resolver:** Determines the outcomes of plays based on the strategic positions of cards on the grid and the specific tactics used.

### Shared Components

- **Card Component:** A reusable widget representing a card. Can be customized with different data bindings for player stats or play actions.
- **Game Board:** While primarily used in Tactical Gridiron, a simplified version can be used in Gridiron Master for representing play outcomes visually.
- **User Interface (UI) Kit:** Includes buttons, dialogs, and other common elements that maintain consistency across the different game modes.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Create Basic Flutter Structure:** Setup the project with main.dart and necessary dependencies.
2. **Build UI Components:** Develop the reusable UI components that will make up the visual part of the application.
3. **Implement Game Engines:** Each game will have a distinct set of rules and logic encapsulated within its own module.
4. **Integrate Data Management:** Setup models and controllers for managing game state and player data.
5. **Add Networking Capabilities:** If multiplayer functionality is desired, implement networking to handle multiplayer sessions.
6. **Testing and Optimization:** Ensure that the app works seamlessly across different devices and configurations.

By designing the app with modular components that can be reused and adapted across different games, development effort and time can be optimized, while maintaining the flexibility to expand with new features or games in the future. Each part of the app can be developed in parallel after setting up the basic architecture, allowing for efficient progress through the use of agile development practices.
