To effectively model the data for the three card games ("Gridiron Master," "Field Command," and "Tactical Gridiron") in your Flutter app, it's crucial to ensure that each model captures all the necessary details for gameplay. Let's review each game's requirements and the fields in the models I previously described, then discuss whether any additional fields might be needed.

### Review of Each Game's Data Requirements

#### Gridiron Master

1. **Player Cards**: Attributes like speed, strength, and specific roles (e.g., QB, RB, WR) are crucial.
2. **Play Cards**: Types of plays (Run, Pass, Special Teams), along with effect modifiers based on situations.
3. **Game State**: Needs to track the current play, score, and position on the field.

#### Field Command

1. **Player Cards**: Similar to "Gridiron Master," but might also include endurance or tactical skills to reflect the strategy over a season.
2. **Play Cards**: Strategic plays affecting multiple rounds or games, not just single moves.
3. **Game State**: More complex state tracking across multiple games or a season, including player health and stats over time.

#### Tactical Gridiron

1. **Player Cards**: Must include positional data for use on a grid, like coordinates or allowed moves.
2. **Play Cards**: Should include specifics about how they modify the game grid or player positions.
3. **Game State**: Detailed tracking of player positions on the grid, current game phase, and specific game rules being applied.

### Current Fields in Models

- **Player**: `id`, `name`, `speed`, `strength`
- **GameState**: `gameId`, `currentPlayerId`, `stateDetails`
- **Card**: `cardId`, `type`, `power`

### Additional Fields and Adjustments Needed

1. **Player**
   - Add roles or positions (e.g., `role` field for QB, RB, WR, etc.).
   - Include tactical attributes like `agility` or `endurance` for strategic games.
   - Positional attributes for "Tactical Gridiron" (e.g., `x_position`, `y_position`).

2. **Card**
   - Differentiate between player cards and play cards more explicitly if needed.
   - Include details for play effects (e.g., `effect_description` that explains what the card does).
   - Additional attributes to handle different types of plays and their strategic implications.

To adapt the `GameState` model for use across all three games while accommodating their unique requirements, we can use Dart's object-oriented capabilities, specifically inheritance. We'll define a base `GameState` class that handles common game state features. Then, we'll extend this base class to create specialized versions for each game, which will manage game-specific state attributes.
